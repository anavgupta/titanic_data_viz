## Summary

This is a data visualization of the Titanic Dataset taken from the Kaggle
website. This dataset contains a sample of 891 individuals from the total 2224 individuals present on the
Titanic Ship.

In this data visualizaiton project, I would like to showcase the fact
that:

* The Females were more likely to be saved than Males. That the gender of the
individual mattered in their survival.
* The Upper class individuals were twice more likely to be saved than the
individuals from the lower class.


## Design

To draw comparisons between the survival of an individual and various categories they belong to, I chose Bar charts. Bar Charts enabled me to visually distinguish how the chance of survival of an Individual varied for various categories.

I choose "Red" color to show the individuals who perished and "Blue" color to show the individual who survived. I have worked on stock market where red is an indicator of share's price going down and blue of price going up. So, I made my color choice on the basis of this.


## Feedback

#### From Prasad
Please add some Heading to the graphs. The Font of the axis seems very dull. Please use better titles for the Axis. some issue with the Count and Percent buttons.

The feedback was taken into consideration and changes were made in the second iteration of the Project.

#### From Raman

Visualizations seems fine. The whole page could have a better feel to it. You could improve upon your front-end and give a sense of story to whole page.

### From Kanav
