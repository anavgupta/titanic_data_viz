## Summary

This is a data visualization of the Titanic Dataset taken from the Kaggle
website. This dataset contains a sample of 891 individuals from the total 2224 individuals present on the
Titanic Ship.

In this data visualizaiton project, I would like to showcase the fact
that:

* The Females were more likely to be saved than Males. That the gender of the
individual mattered in their survival.
* The Upper class individuals were twice more likely to be saved than the
individuals from the lower class.
